                <p id="nw1">Nearly half of all children in sub-Saharan Africa are living in extreme poverty, according to a joint Unicef-World Bank report released on Tuesday, with figures showing that almost 385 million children worldwide survive on less than $1.90
                  (£1.50) a day, the World Bank international poverty line. World Bank to name and shame countries that fail to prevent stunting in children Read more Extreme poverty leads to stunted development, limited future productivity as adults,
                  and intergenerational transmission of poverty, the report (pdf) says. The figures – based on data from 89 countries, and representing 84% of the developing world’s population – indicate that much work will be needed to meet the sustainable
                  development goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. Children are disproportionately affected by extreme poverty – they make up just a third of the population studied, but comprise half of the extreme poor. They are twice as likely
                  as adults to be living on less than $1.90 a day, the report claims, with 19.5% of children in developing countries living in extremely poor households, compared to just 9.2% of adults. “It’s almost a double blow – firstly, that children
                  are twice as likely as an adult to live in extreme poverty, but also that children are much less likely than an adult to be able to cope with extreme poverty because of stunting, infant mortality, and early childhood development,” said
                  Unicef’s deputy executive director, Justin Forsyth.</p>

                <p id="nw2">More than half (58%) of children living in such countries live in extremely poor households, according to the report, increasing their risk of inadequate education, healthcare and nutrition. Extreme poverty also increases a child’s risk
                  of being exploited and abused. Unicef and the World Bank are calling on governments to include children in poverty reduction plans and ensure that child poverty is routinely measured and addressed at national levels. Child-sensitive
                  social protection systems, such as cash transfer programmes that pay families directly, are also useful in helping eradicate extreme poverty among children, the report notes. “This is kind of a wake-up call for everyone in the world
                  who’s thinking about their national poverty plans,” said Forsyth. “We have to look through the ‘children’ lens now – not just children but women and children. We’ve got to focus on things that will particularly benefit very poor families,
                  and very poor children.”

                <p id="nw3">Jim Yong Kim, the former physician who heads the Bank, told the Guardian he would take to the podium at the World Economic Forum in Davos every year to point the finger at governments who failed to live up to promises to tackle a scourge
                  affecting tens of millions of children. Kim said stunting – which refers to children with a height considerably below the average for their age – was a humanitarian disaster but also an economic issue that held back nations. Malnutrition,
                  the lack of stimulation and toxic environments take their toll on children’s brain development, modern neuroscience shows. For the sake of their children but also their countries’ future prosperity in a world that increasingly needs
                  an educated workforce with technological skills, governments must take action, said Kim, adding that equality of opportunity was meaningless when children started with such disadvantage. The problem is huge. In India 38.7% of children
                  are stunted, in Pakistan 45% and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo around 43%. “Everyone puts all their eggs in the equality of opportunity basket,” said Kim. “But we’re essentially lying when 25% of children in the world are stunted.
                  Inequality is baked into the brains of 25% of all children before the age of five. So the only way that we can realistically say there is equality of opportunity is if we bring stunting down to zero.”</p>

                <p id="nw5">The estimated number of affected children is now 450,000 (pdf), with 14 million people needing humanitarian assistance across the region. Nigeria is one of four countries the UN has warned is facing famine, along with Somalia, Yemen and
                  South Sudan, where famine was declared on Monday in parts of the country. On Friday, a major international conference, hosted by Nigeria, Norway and Germany, will be held in Oslo aimed at increasing funding for the crisis in north-east
                  Nigeria and the wider Lake Chad region. Nigeria’s north-east has for decades been poor, underdeveloped and dominated by agricultural industry and subsistence farming. In the past four years, the insurgency by Boko Haram has exacerbated
                  problems in the region, leaving it further impoverished and facing a severe lack of food. The insecurity has left many farmers unable to plant or harvest their crops. In Borno state, 5.8 million people face extreme food and nutrition
                  deficits, a figure that has doubled in the past year. According to Doune Porter, chief of communication for Unicef in Nigeria, the international community has failed to grasp the seriousness of the need for financial support in the region.
                  “Last year we had a funding appeal of $115m [£92.4m] but we received just 41%,” he said. “We’ve still managed to do what we can. In the final eight weeks of last year we were able to scale up our aid by 37%. It’s made an impact, but
                  without increased funding these are fragile gains.” When humanitarian workers are able to access insecure areas, helping children suffering from severe acute malnutrition is straightforward, according to Porter. “Treating them is a simple
                  eight-week out-patient process that is really effective in helping develop their diet and health.” Around 1.8 million people are internally displaced with most living in accommodating – but increasingly populated – host communities.
                  In the heat, some mothers feed water to their babies below the age of six months, which has increased malnutrition, especially in areas where water purity is low. Porter said that campaigns have been very effective in explaining to women
                  that feeding infants exclusively with breast milk is the best way to prevent malnutrition.

                <p id="nw6">But the fleets of aircraft that dominate the airport of South Sudan’s capital are just one part of a complex and sophisticated humanitarian response to famine, which was declared in parts of the country’s north on Monday and looms simultaneously
                  in three other countries for the first time in modern history. Aid these days for countries such as Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria and South Sudan – where eight airdrops of food are planned on Tuesday to some of the country’s worst-affected
                  communities – means far more than just sacks of grain being trucked out to remote areas. The material being delivered today includes highly nutritious “super cereals”, seeds and tools for fishermen and farmers, even boat engines, irrigation
                  pipes and beekeeping kits. Famine looms in four countries as aid system struggles to cope, experts warn Read more Non-food aid, too, is increasingly prominent, with cash transfers delivered via credit cards for use in local markets and
                  tracked by aid planners. For those at the centre of masterminding a massive food distribution push already under way, however, the difference between success and failure hinges on whether donors will stump up the more than $5.6bn (£4.5bn)
                  requested to tackle food insecurity in the four countries. “There are a huge number of crises in the world, and to have four countries on the brink of famine at the same time is unprecedented,” says Denise Brown, director of emergencies
                  at the World Food Programme (WFP), the word’s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger. “We have never seen that before and with all of these crises, they are protracted situations and they require significant financing. The international
                  community has got to find a way of stepping up to manage this situation until political solutions are found,” she adds. A veteran of Somalia’s 2011 famine, which claimed the lives of more than a quarter of a million people, one of Brown’s
                  priorities is scaling up its food assistance caseload for the country to reach 2.5 million people, up from 500,000. On Tuesday, Save the Children, warned that the crisis in Somalia could be worse than 2011. An estimated 363,000 children
                  are already malnourished, and the organisation’s staff have recently been seeing a significant increase in severe cases coming through the doors of their clinics.</p>
